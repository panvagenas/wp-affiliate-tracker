Easy track and cloack affiliate links.

== Description ==

Hide long affiliate links and know which keywords are driving sales!

Short and pretty links instead of long affiliate URLs
This plugin lets you create pretty and short links (for example:
/mylink) on your Wordpress installation to cloak (hide) long Affiliate
links (such as http://05cf362lmptkqtdfuriqlimu7u.hop.clickbank.net/).

Track your best performing keywords
In addition, it lets you keep track  of and clock variables like
keywords passed to your affiliate links. For example, if you are running
a Google AdWords campaign, you can track which search term converts best
at your affiliate vendor. This is done by associating keywords with a
short anonymized ID that is passed with the affiliate link - this way,
the affiliate vendor will never know which of your keywords are the most
successful!
